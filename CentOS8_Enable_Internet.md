# Installed CentOS 8 on a VirtulaBox and the host cannot connect to Internet?

## Here is a quick fix you can do:
### Get the NAT Adapter for the Host and open the corresponding "interface network script"
    * $ ip link show
      1: lo: <LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 65536 qdisck state UNKNOWN mode DEFAULT group default qlen 100
          ....
          ....
      2: enp0s3: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> .........
          ....
          ....
      3: enp0s8: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> .........
          ....
          ....
     
     Here 'enp0s3' is the "NAT Adapter" for my VirtualBox with CentOS8
### Open the corresposning network-script file, ex: /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-enp0s3
    And put following lines
    
    ```
     DNS1=8.8.8.8
     DNS2=8.8.4.4
     #Change ONBOOT to yes, if it is set to no
     ONBOOT=yes
    ```
  ## You are all set!!
